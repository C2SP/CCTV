# age test vectors

This directory contains a large set of test vectors for the age file encryption
format, as well as a framework to easily generate them.

For an example of how to use this test suite, check [the reference Go
implementation](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age/blob/bf8d2a39/testkit_test.go).

## Test file format

Each file in the `testdata` folder is a separate test vector, meant to be
processed independently. Each vector is meant to test only one failure (or
success) scenario.

The file is in two parts: first a textual header, then an empty line, and then
an age encrypted file. The textual header is a series of key-value pairs,
separated by a colon and a space, each on their own line.

The following header keys are defined. Files with unknown keys should be
ignored.

- `expect`

  This key defines what the result of decrypting the file should be.
  Distinguishing between different types of failure can be important to avoid
  masking what should be a lower-level error (for example, a parsing error) with
  a higher-level error (for example, incorrect HMAC because the incorrectly
  parsed file was re-encoded before calculating the HMAC). However, they might
  not map effectively to your API, in which case you should consider aliasing
  indistinguishable cases. It can take the following values.

  * `success`

    The file should decrypt correctly all the way to EOF, and the payload should
    match the expected hash (see below).

  * `no match`

    The header should parse successfully, but none of the recipient stanzas can
    be unwrapped.

  * `HMAC failure`

    The header should parse successfully, and a file key can be unwrapped, but
    the header HMAC should not match.

  * `header failure`

    The header should fail to parse successfully.

  * `payload failure`

    The header should parse successfully, and a file key can be unwrapped, but
    the STREAM-encrypted payload doesn't decrypt successfully all the way to
    EOF. **Whatever payload decrypted successfully before encountering the error
    must be checked against the payload hash (see below).**

  * `armor failure`

    The ASCII armor should fail to parse successfully.

- `payload`

  This is a hex-encoded SHA-256 hash of the payload. **All** the plaintext that
  would have been released to the application by the API must match this hash,
  even if the decryption eventually fails.

- `identity`

  This is a Bech32 encoded X25519 identity that should be used to unwrap
  recipient stanzas. This key can appear multiple times.

- `passphrase`

  This is a passphrase that should be used to unwrap `scrypt` recipient stanzas.
  This key can appear multiple times.

- `armored`

  This key will be `yes` if the file is supposed to be encoded in the optional
  ASCII armor.

- `file key`

  This is the hex-encoded file key, to aid debugging. This can be ignored.

- `comment`

  This is a textual comment that explains the vector. This can be ignored.

## The testkit framework

Every test vector in `testdata` is generated by a corresponding file in
`internal/tests`, using the framework in `internal/testkit`.

To generate the files, run

```
go generate ./...
```
